- Implement proper operation handles that allow users to wait for specific events
- Clean up the read operation for clients
- Check that the corner case where read and writes go over the length of the file work correctly
- Return the number of bytes read or written in the MouseFS_Result struct
- Make parallel uploads/downloads configurable
- Recalculate next write locations whenever a write occurs, not at each read
- avoid replay attacks
- find a way to remove over-replicated chunks and formalize the chunk management policy
- add logging of:
    - when chunk servers connect and disconnect to the metadata server
- Should list scenarios that need testing, like those where chunks would be dropped

Roadmap:
    [ ] Complete all endpoints
    [ ] Add fault injections to the simulation
    [ ] Implement WAL

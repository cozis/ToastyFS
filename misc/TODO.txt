[ ] Make parallel uploads/downloads configurable
[ ] Recalculate next write locations whenever a write occurs, not at each read
[ ] avoid replay attacks
[ ] add logging (when chunk servers connect and disconnect to the metadata server)
[ ] Should list scenarios that need testing, like those where chunks would be dropped

# ToastyFS
ToastyFS is a distributed file system for personal use. It's designed to be pragmatic, understandable, and robust.

## Testing
ToastyFS is tested by running an in-memory simulation of a cluster with many clients running hundreds of random operations in parallel. The test is run for long periods of times under valgrind or compiled with sanitizers.

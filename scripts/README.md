# Branch Coverage Measurement

This directory contains scripts for measuring branch coverage of the random simulation.

## Prerequisites

The HTML report generation requires `lcov`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install lcov
```

## Usage

### Quick text summary (5 second simulation)
```bash
make coverage-report
```

### HTML report with branch details (5 second simulation)
```bash
make coverage-html
```

### Custom duration
```bash
./scripts/measure_coverage.sh 10          # 10 second run, text output
./scripts/measure_coverage.sh 10 --html   # 10 second run, HTML output
```

## What gets measured

The coverage tool:
- Builds the test binary with coverage instrumentation (`--coverage` flag)
- Runs the random simulation for the specified duration
- Generates reports showing which branches were executed

## Output

**Text report**: Shows per-file and total branch coverage percentages

**HTML report**: Interactive report generated by lcov/genhtml showing:
- Overall coverage summary
- Per-file coverage breakdown
- Source code with execution counts
- Branch coverage details

The HTML report is generated in `coverage_report/index.html`
